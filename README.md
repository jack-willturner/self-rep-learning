# [Self-Supervised Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09005)
PyTorch replication of papers studied in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09005).

`main.py` currently trains a very very small ResNet, and then chops off the last layers and optimises a logistic regression model with L-BFGS to fit the representations generated by our new amputated model.

More models and experiments coming soon...
